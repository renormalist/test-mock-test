Test-Mock-Test

This module mocks all typical test function from modules

  Test::More
  Test::Most
  Test::Deep

to always return ok. In particular this means their test functionality
is skipped, so the overhead of the tests is dropped and reduced to
only the function call overhead.

You can use this to benchmark distribution by running the code from
their test suites without the test overhead itself.
